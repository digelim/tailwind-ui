# TailwindUI
A rendered preview of all TailwindUI components, bundled into one single file

## About

Currently, you have to click the `code` button to be able see each block individually, but the preview is just a static image. The goal of this repository is to make it easy to navigate through the TailwindUI components, and improve the preview by rendering them onto the page.

## Installation

The easiest way to install it is to clone this repository into a web server. There are no other dependencies or requirements.

## Usage

Navigate by pressing Up and Down from your keyboard.

## Next steps

The navigation and code organization can be further improved. The next step would be to find the ideal navigation type, and make it even more accessible. Some ideas are:

- Drag & Drop interface;
- Visible keyboard shortcodes;
- Components filtering & search.
